            My name is Ross Garwood. I am a drafter. I would like to become a
            Civil Engineer. I have my associateâ€™s degree in Drafting & Design
            which can be a first step toward becoming a Civil Engineer. My
            degree enabled me to get a job in the field to gain experience in
            engineering.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            I enjoy collecting hats, movies, and bow ties. I am best recognized
            wearing a bow tie. They keep me unique and can give others the
            impressions of confidence, politeness, and neatness, sending a
            friendly message to the people around me. I wear them for various
            occasions, such as at work (allowed), attend friends and family
            gatherings, at bars and supermarkets, on the planes, etc. Many of my
            friends enjoy this quirk of mine, and friendly call me "Mr. Bowtie"
            as a nickname to remember me. In addition, I enjoy the relaxing time
            to watch old movies or TV series with my family at home.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            I also enjoy some outside activities. I like swimming, snorkeling,
            and padding sports such as row boat and kayak.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            Furthermore, I would like to mention here as my one of life
            accomplishments is that I am particularly proud of rolling my first
            car down Mt. Rainier in 2007. I bent and twisted almost every piece
            of mental on the car (except the front passage door which worked
            better after the accident) after rolling it 7 times down a steep
            rocky slope. This incident is used for training purpose of new
            employees at Mountain River, I have been treated like a celebrity
            when every time I visited the mountain.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            I am an idealistic and humorous person who likes to share
            interesting stories with the people around me. Please go to my hobby
            page if you want to learn more about me.
